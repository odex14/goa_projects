#Inputs&Outputs
#In computing, input/output (I/O, i/o, or informally io or IO) is the communication between an information processing 
#system, such as a computer, and the outside world, such as another computer system, peripherals, or a human operator.
# Inputs are the signals or data received by the system and outputs are the signals or data sent from it.
# The term can also be used as part of an action; to "perform I/O" is to perform an input or output operation.

#Connection
#In formal language theory and computer programming, string concatenation is the operation of joining character strings end-to-end.
# For example, the concatenation of "snow" and "ball" is "snowball".
# In certain formalisations of concatenation theory, also called string theory, string concatenation is a primitive notion.
